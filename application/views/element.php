<h1>Mitnick sneezes, breaks into Pentagon</h1><div class="htimeauth">26:00 | 03/17/2006 | <a href="#">author</a></div>
<p>I'm not very creative, so I stole my favorite news headline from OWD/OSWD user antipop's extent template</p>
<blockquote><p>This morning a source close to the celebrated hacker <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick">Kevin Mitnick</a> reported that he might be coming down with a bad cold. The source said the cold was so bad that when he sneezed he suddenly had root on the Pentagon's computers.</p></blockquote>
<p>For those of us who have followed Kevin's hacking career we already knew he was s00p3r 31337 but this proves it.</p>
